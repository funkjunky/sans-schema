Everyone is welcome and encouraged to contribute!

If you have any issues, or suggestions, please add an issue on the [Github issue list](https://github.com/funkjunky/sans-schema/issues).

If you want to submit code, make sure the tests are passing ```npm test``` and submit a pull request.

FYI to build the code for submission, run ```npm run build```

It would be greatly appreciated if you added tests for any features added.

Thanks!

Side note: If you want stricter regulations on this library, like code policing, commit policing, etc. feel free to fork it and start your own repository. That said, I well never add such restrictions, because I consider them detrimental to the progress of development, development speed, and developer experience.
